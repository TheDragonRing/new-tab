New Tab
=======
-------
The default Google Chrome new tab page just doesn't cut it. You want something you can really customize. Well, here you go! Aptly named "New Tab" lets you do that and more.

Features:
---------

  **Background** â€” This chrome extension let you upload your own image as the new tab page background image.

  **Search Bar** - Sure it replaces the default new tab page... But you don't lose that handy search bar! A JavaScript powered custom search bar that'll either send you to a URL or a Google Search (depending on your input) is there in it's place.

Downloading & Installing:
-------------------------

  **Downloading** - Go to https://thedragonring.me/projects, find New Tab and click the download button.

  **Installing** -

    1: Go into the index.html file.

    2: Modify line 17, so instead of saying "<h1>Hello, New Tab</h1>", it says "<h1>Hello, Your Name</h1>".

    3: Replace the background.png (found in the assets folder) file with a background image of your choice (it must be called background.png - if it is a JPEG or GIF file then you either have to edit line 20 of the styles.css file or use a file converter).

    4: Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.

    5: Make sure developer mode is turned on (look in the top right corner) and then click on "Load unpacked extension...".

    6: Select the downloaded folder with all your New Tab files in it.

    7: Click "OK".

    8: Open a new tab to make sure it's worked!

  _You may occasionally get warnings from Google Chrome saying you are using an extension in developer mode. Always click cancel otherwise you will have to go through steps 4-8 again. Do not delete the folder with all your New tab files in it! Google Chrome is getting the new tab page directly from these files, so put them somewhere safe before doing steps 4-8._
